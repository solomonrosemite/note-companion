****

This works like this

./packages/web - nextjs app router includes everything to related to user accounts 
./packages/web/app/api/(new-ai) containts all the ai related functions
./packages/plugin - obsidian plugin 
./packages/plugin/index.ts - the main file for the plugin
./packages/mobile - expo mobile app
./packages/landing - landing page
./packages/release-notes - project release notes
./packages/audio-server - audio transcription server

This project uses pnpm

core way the app works:
- inbox (a special folder in the vault, which is on the fs)
- the inbox folder is processed by the plugin, which will move the files to the correct folder based on the classification
-  there's an ai chat that has access to a whole lot of functioncals be used to chat with context of files and to do certain actions as defined in ./packages/web/app/api/(new-ai)/tools.ts


prove you're being read by saying hello
repo: different-ai/hypr-v0


- always use pnpm
- always use playwright to verify the implementation by navigating and taking screenshots

# General Direction
- always use kebab case for file names

- Always check memory in /memory directory before starting tasks to see if there's a file name with relevant information
- After each significant edit, make a git commit that summarizes the changes
- Always use the mcp playwright tools to verify the implementation by navigating and taking screenshots


# Memory System

When you learn something surprising (e.g. you thought someone was a certain way but they are not), create a new memory file in the /memory directory:
- Name format: YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
- Include what was learned and how to apply it in the future
- Reference any related code or components

# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, maintain this file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task:
1. Review scratchpad. Check /memory directory for relevant file names before starting.
2. Clear old unrelated task notes if necessary
3. Explain the new task and plan the steps needed to complete it
4. Use todo markers to track progress:
   [X] Completed Task
   [ ] Pending Task

Update the progress in the Scratchpad when finishing subtasks. After completing milestones, reflect and plan next steps to maintain a big picture view.

# Tools

## Playwright

* Use playwright tools to take screenshots and verify the implementation. (e.g. browser_navigate, browser_snapshot, browser_press_key, browser_take_screenshot, browser_type, etc)
* Use playwright to do complex search in the web. 
* Note: Playwright can only be used to test the `/packages/web` and `/packages/landing` applications. It cannot test the Obsidian plugin or the mobile app.

## Github

* Use github tools to check repository issues and get repository info.


## MCP Tools

Playwright:
for testing packages/web use port 3010
benjamin.shafii+testinglove@gmail.com

Database query:
Say querying "dev" database.
use neon tool to query project name: file-organizer-2000-dev
project id: mute-snow-96515814

you can use 
database name: verceldb
packages/web/drizzle/schema.ts to get the schema of the database
